# yma_bsf_pop_diff_pool_seq
### Codes in "steps" recording every step I analyse with the result of sequencing. From the raw Illumina genome sequencing data to the population difference analyse (Fst) and genetic variance (Tajima's D)
### As for the snakemake file to popoolation and popoolation2. You can look up to the other reporsitory "backup". I changed some parameters in snakemake workflow.
